## Overview

Applypilot helps job seekers manage their entire application journey without leaving the browser.

While viewing a supported job posting, Applypilot can detect the visible job information, let you review or edit the captured details, and save the job locally.

Saved applications can then be managed through the extension popup, side panel, or full dashboard.

## Key Features

- Detect job information from the current browser tab
- Review and edit detected details before saving
- Save jobs directly from supported job boards
- Track application status and progress
- View recently saved jobs
- Add follow-up, interview, and deadline reminders
- Manage applications from a browser side panel
- Explore analytics from a full dashboard
- Prevent duplicate entries using job URL, company, and title
- Store all application data locally in the browser
- Use minimal browser permissions

## Product Experience

### Extension Popup

The popup is designed for quick actions.

Use it to:

- detect the current job posting
- review the captured information
- edit job details before saving
- save a job with one click
- open the side panel
- open the full dashboard

### Side Panel

The side panel provides a larger workspace while you continue browsing.

Use it to:

- save and edit job postings
- view recently saved jobs
- update application statuses
- access job details
- review upcoming reminders
- manage applications without leaving the current tab

### Dashboard

The dashboard is the main workspace for managing larger amounts of application data.

It includes:

- complete application management
- searchable and structured job views
- application analytics
- status tracking
- source and company insights
- reminder management
- export-oriented workflows

## How It Works

1. Open a supported job posting.
2. Open the Applypilot popup or side panel.
3. Applypilot detects the visible job information.
4. Review the captured details.
5. Edit any incorrect or missing information.
6. Save the job to your local workspace.
7. Track the application later from the side panel or dashboard.

## Privacy

Applypilot follows a local-first approach.

Your saved jobs, application statuses, reminders, and other tracking data are stored locally using browser storage.

Applypilot does not require an account for its core functionality.

The extension is designed to request only the permissions needed for job detection, local storage, and the browser side panel.

## Duplicate Detection

Applypilot attempts to prevent duplicate job records using the following checks:

1. Exact job URL
2. Company name and job title

Each saved record also includes:

- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

## Tech Stack

- [WXT](https://wxt.dev/)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- shadcn/ui
- Radix UI primitives
- TanStack Form
- TanStack Table
- Zod
- Sonner
- pnpm

## Browser Permissions

Applypilot currently uses the following permissions:

```txt
activeTab
scripting
sidePanel
storage
```

Future job-board support should continue using the narrowest possible host permissions.
